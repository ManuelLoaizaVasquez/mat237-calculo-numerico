\begin{statement}{2}
  Write a function that performs inverse quadratic interpolation for
  finding a root of $f$, give three initial estimates.
  To find the quadratic polynomial $q(y)$ passing through the three most recent points,
  use the built-in \texttt{polyfit} command.
  Test your function on the first problem from this section.
\end{statement}

\begin{solution}
  The following function performs inverse quadratic interpolation
  \lstinputlisting{scripts/algorithms/iqi.m}
  Examples 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 analyze the function $f(x) = x e^x - 2$
  and Example 4.4.3 the function $f(x) = x + \cos(10x)$ with real domain.
  We are going to test our function with these examples
  \lstinputlisting{scripts/problems/problem-02.m}
  obtaining the following roots:
