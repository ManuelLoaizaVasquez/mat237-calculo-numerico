\begin{statement}{2}
  Write a function that performs inverse quadratic interpolation for
  finding a root of $f$, give three initial estimates.
  To find the quadratic polynomial $q(y)$ passing through the three most recent points,
  use the built-in \texttt{polyfit} command.
  Test your function on the first problem from this section.
