\begin{statement}{7}
  Theorem $9.3.1$ assumes that the function being approximated has
  infinitely many derivatives over $[-1, 1]$. But now consider the family of functions
  $f_m(x) = |x|^m$.
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{a}
  How many continuous derivatives over $[-1, 1]$ does $f_m$ possess?
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{b}
  Compute the polynomial interpolant using $n$ second-kind Chebyshev
  nodes in $[-1, 1]$ for $n = 10, 20, 30, \dots, 100$.
  At each value of $n$, compute the infinity-norm error.
  (that is, $\max|p(x) - f_m(x)|$ evaluated for at least $41000$ values of $x$).
  Using a single log-log grpah, plot the error as a function of $n$ for all six values $m = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11$.
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{c}
  Based on the result of parts (a) and (b), form a hypothesis about the asymptotic behaviour
  of the error for fixed $m$ as $n \to \infty$.
\end{statement}
